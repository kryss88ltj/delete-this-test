      <p class="sylvia-text">I thought I had gleaned a good grasp on the concepts in my years as a &#34;designer&#34; - I use that word loosely, as I&#39;d had no training and only a moderate understanding of design.  But only in meeting a true master could I understand my amateur status. I was blind to the colors all around me, even in the whitest whites and deepest blacks. This collection is only a snippet of what she teaches every art director and designer at the Creative Circus, should they be so lucky to learn from the best. And if you&#39;re a rising designer, reading these simple cliffnotes before you take color theory, <span class="bold">How can you live with yourself?</span></p>

      <h1 class="bourges-title">THE BOURGES COLOR WHEEL</h1> 
      <p class="bourges-text">The Bourges color chart was developed by Jean Bourges in the mid-1900s in an attempt to redefine the way we classify and use color. She debuted her system in Color Bytes and explained that she intended to expand on Albert Munsell&#39;s 10-sectio<span class="n">n</span> system to explore color from a myriad of different angles and perspectives. Bourges was one of Sylvia&#39;s most significant influences, in addition to Dewey Sadka and the Pope, who surely wears a hat.</p>

          As you combine more of one primary color than another into your secondary color, we move into tertiary families, RED-ORANGE,  YELLOW-ORANGE, YELLOW-GREEN, BLUE-GREEN, BLUE-VIOLET &#38; RED-VIOLET.
